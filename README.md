# WordPress-Books-Plugin
This plugin allows admins to manage book inventory in WooCommerce using a barcode scanner to input ISBN codes

This plugin is under development and was started during my time as a volunteer in an Oxfam secondhand store to provide some way of managing the enormous amounts of secondhand books that pass through their stores.
In the future this will be rewritten with generic prefixes as there is interest outside of Oxfam stores for such a plugin.

DISCLAIMER
This is not an official plugin of Oxfam nor am I affiliated with them in any other way than being a former volunteer!
